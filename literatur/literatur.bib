	abstract = {Background. Chronic urticaria ({CU}) is a skin condition characterised by repeated occurrence of itchy wheals and/or angioedema for {\textgreater}6 weeks. Aim. To provide data demonstrating the real-life burden of {CU} in the {UK}.
Methods. This {UK} subset of the worldwide, prospective, non-interventional {AWARE} study included patients aged 18–75 years diagnosed with H1-antihistamine (H1-{AH})-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria ({CSU}) for {\textgreater}2 months. Baseline characteristics, disease activity, treatments, comorbidities and healthcare resource use were documented. Quality of life, work productivity and activity impairment were assessed.
Results. Baseline analysis included 252 {UK} patients. Mean age and body mass index were 45.0 years and 29.0 kg/m2, respectively. Most patients were female (77.8\%) and had moderate/severe disease activity (mean Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days, 18.4) and a ‘spontaneous’ component to their {CU} (73.4\% {CSU}; 24.6\% {CSU} and chronic inducible urticaria). Common comorbidities included depression/anxiety (24.6\%), asthma (23.8\%) and allergic rhinitis (12.7\%). A previous treatment was recorded for 57.9\% of patients. Mean Dermatology Life Quality Index score was 9.5 and patients reported impairments in work productivity and activity. Healthcare resource use was high. Severity of {CSU} was associated with gender, obesity, anxiety and diagnosis. Only 28.5\% of patients completed all nine study visits, limiting analysis of long-term treatment patterns and disease impact.
Conclusions. Adult H1-{AH}-refractory {CU} patients in the {UK} reported high rates of healthcare resource use and impairment in quality of life, work productivity and activity at baseline. The differing structures of {UK} healthcare may explain the high study discontinuation rates versus other countries.},
